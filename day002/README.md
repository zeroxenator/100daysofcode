# Get Middle Character

You are going to be given a word. Your job is to return the middle character of the word. If the word's length is odd, return the middle character. If the word's length is even, return the middle 2 characters.

#### Examples:

```python
Kata.getMiddle("test") should return "es"

Kata.getMiddle("testing") should return "t"

Kata.getMiddle("middle") should return "dd"

Kata.getMiddle("A") should return "A"
```

### Input

A word (string) of length `0 < str < 1000` (In javascript you may get slightly more than 1000 in some test cases due to an error in the test cases). You do not need to test for this. This is only here to tell you that you do not need to worry about your solution timing out.

### Output

The middle character(s) of the word represented as a string.

# Is Triangle?

Implement a method that accepts 3 integer values a, b, c. The method should return true if a triangle can be built with the sides of given length and false in any other case.

(In this case, all triangles must have surface greater than 0 to be accepted).
